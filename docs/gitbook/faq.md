### A/B Testing

When should I use A/B testing instead of progressive traffic shifting?

For frontend applications that require session affinity you should use HTTP headers or cookies match conditions
to ensure a set of users will stay on the same version for the whole duration of the canary analysis.
A/B testing is supported by Istio and NGINX only.

Istio example:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    # schedule interval (default 60s)
    interval: 1m
    # total number of iterations
    iterations: 10
    # max number of failed iterations before rollback
    threshold: 2
    # canary match condition
    match:
      - headers:
          x-canary:
            regex: ".*insider.*"
      - headers:
          cookie:
            regex: "^(.*?;)?(canary=always)(;.*)?$"
```

NGINX example:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    interval: 1m
    threshold: 10
    iterations: 2
    match:
      - headers:
          x-canary:
            exact: "insider"
      - headers:
          cookie:
            exact: "canary"
```

The above configurations will route users with the x-canary header or canary cookie to the canary instance during analysis:

```bash
curl -H 'X-Canary: insider' http://app.example.com
curl -b 'canary=always' http://app.example.com
```
